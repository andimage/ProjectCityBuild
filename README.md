The official repository for [Project City Build](https://projectcitybuild.com)'s homepage and related web services.

### Stack
* Frameworks: Laravel 8, ReactJS 16
* Environment: Docker Compose
* CI/CD: Github Actions, Codecov

All branches, commits and pull-requests are continuously tested

### Requirements
* Docker and Docker Compose

### Can I contribute?
Absolutely. Feel free to fork and send pull requests any time. We'd be thrilled to have some help.

# Contributing

We use Docker Compose to orchestrate a development environment.
If you're using Windows we highly recommend that you run it through [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).

## First time setup

1. Run `cp .env.example .env`, then edit the file as appropriate (see below)
2. Run `make bootstrap`

You'll then be able to access the website at `http://localhost`

## Development
Once *First time setup* is complete, you only need to run one command to boot up the environment:

`docker-compose up -d` to start Sail

If necessary, you can enter the container at any time with `make shell`

### Front-end

For front-end development, run `make watch`. 

This will start BrowserSync on `http://localhost:3000` which automatically builds CSS, JS and static assets
when any file change occurs.

### HTTPS
You'll need to install [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) so that HTTPS works locally (https://localhost). 
We don't install this automatically because installation steps differ based on your OS and distribution.

Then run `mkcert -install`

> If you're using WSL (Windows) with Firefox, you'll need to install mkcert on Windows too, then perform [these extra steps](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#windows-and-firefox-mkcert-install-additional-instructions)
> followed by [these steps](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/3161#issuecomment-451863149).

`make bootstrap` will automatically generate the certificate for you. 
Should you need to regenerate the certificate, you can run `make cert`

### Database
If the database schema has changed, remember to run `php artisan migrate` from within the php-fpm container to ensure you always have the latest schema.

### S3 Bucket
Backups go to an S3 bucket specified in the `backup` disk. To run this functionality in development, you need to configure a valid bucket. To avoid having to use a real one:

1. Go to `http://localhost:9000`, using the credentials minioadmin/minioadmin
2. Make a bucket called `pcb-backup`
3. Put this in your `.env`:

```dotenv
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=minioadmin
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=minioadmin
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_BUCKET=pcb-backup
AWS_ENDPOINT="http://minio:9000"
AWS_URL="http://minio:9000"
```

### Stripe Webhooks
You can trigger webhook events via the Stripe CLI container. 
The container (while running) is constantly listening for events. 

* Run `make stripe payment` to send a payment webhook event

## Testing
* Run `make test` to run all unit/integration tests
* Run `docker-compose exec php-fpm phpstan -c phpstan.neon` to run PHP analysis
