# Project City Build

Version 3.5 - basically just a supercharged, coat of fresh paint on the current design.

## What's different about this version?
Mostly behind the scenes stuff.
* Mobile responsive
* Powered by Laravel
* A few UI components are powered by ReactJS (eg. the server feed)
* Version 1 of the Ban API (coming soon)

### What still needs to be built?
- [ ] Ban API
- [ ] Server querying
- [ ] 'Recent Posts' sidebar integration with SMF
- [ ] Ban appeals
- [ ] Donations
- [ ] Apply for staff
- [ ] Ban list
- [ ] General polish

If there's time, I'd also like to automate donation processing, but I doubt it'll get done by the release date.

### When will this release?
Tentatively aiming for the end of this month (September 2017).

### Can I contribute?
Absolutely. Feel free to have at it and send pull requests any time. I'd be thrilled to have some help since I'm very short on time.
